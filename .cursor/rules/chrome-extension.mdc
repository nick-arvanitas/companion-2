# Development Environment & Setup

I'm currently working on a **Chrome Manifest V3** extension using the **sidePanel** API.

- **Framework:** React 19 (latest React version)
- **UI Library:** Shadcn UI (for component primitives and design system)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling)
- **Build Tool:** Vite (fast React tooling, assumed for modern React projects)
- **Extension Features:**  
  - Uses Manifest V3 with service worker background scripts  
  - Implements React-based UI inside the sidePanel  
  - Focused on performant, modular, and scalable component design  
- **Additional Notes:**  
  - Ensuring compatibility with Chrome's Manifest V3 policies  
  - Using React 19's concurrent features where applicable  
  - Leveraging Tailwind for rapid, responsive design  
  - Using Shadcn UI for accessible, customizable UI primitives  
  - Handling Chrome extension-specific APIs (sidePanel, storage, messaging) with React hooks

If you want me to provide a JSON manifest snippet or example React component setup for the sidePanel, just let me know!
